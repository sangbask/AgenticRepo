#  Agentic Loan Collateral Risk & Fraud Detection Dashboard

This Streamlit-powered application provides real-time, AI-driven risk analysis on loan and collateral datasets.  
It empowers financial analysts with a single dashboard to detect:

-  **Fraud Risk** (using Isolation Forest and XGBoost models)
- **Credit Risk** (via credit score and LTV ratio)
-  **Collateral Risk** (with market-aware logic)
-  **Combined Risk Scoring** (fraud + credit + collateral)
